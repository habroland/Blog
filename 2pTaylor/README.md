# Mathematica code for calculating the 2-point Taylor expansion

This folder contains a file with the code and examples I used to calculate the 2-point Taylor expansion of 2n-1 order of a function f at points a and b.

For details please check [my blog post](https://underthemath.wordpress.com/2020/06/12/polynomial-division-revisited/)

I put the code also in plain text in a separate file for those of you who don't have Mathematica software
